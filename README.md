## Preface
I stopped developing this a while ago so I figured out I would give the code "to you, the people".
This project is an extension to original dragonnest.exe executable, you can call this an addon.
It uses wooodoo magic to fix alot of stuff.


### Features
These few things can be implemented:
* Act version 3
* Particle fix
* Lencea/Machina creation via client
* Cryptographic functions (encrypt .pak)
* Packet encryption
* Gameguard (Antihack)
* Radio in-game feature
* Little code to send messages from client, credits go to firev2
* Fixes 2-3 exploits that made gameserver crash
* Craft window for lencea/machina
* F1/F2/F3.. macro fix for lencea/machina
* much much more than you can ever imagine.
